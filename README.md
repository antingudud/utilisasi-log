My attempt at diving face first into the advanced programming ways or whatnot using PHP and AJAx.

So far I've applied the OOP paradigm and MVC pattern. As for the functionalities it self, it's still pretty lacking because I focused only on the aforementioned methods first.

I'll eventually add CRUD, sessions, users, multi level access, exception handler, graphic charts, etc later.
