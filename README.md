Utility website to record a company's bandwidth usage and view monthly or biannual usage.

This is a project where I apply my study on OOP, MVC architecture, and patterns I learned.

So far, I've applied Dependency Injection, Fat Model-Thin Controller, Data Mapper, Repository, Domain Object, and Service Layer.

My current goal is to polish the app, add pagination, enhance my understanding of the above concepts, learn new concepts, and apply them correctly.
